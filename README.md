# TASK_2   LINEAR-REGRESSION
To Explore Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

Data can be found from "http://bit.ly/w-data"

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a
day?

# TASK_3  K-MEANS CLUSTERING
To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of
clusters and represent it visually.

# TASK_4  DECISION TREE ALGORITHM

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
